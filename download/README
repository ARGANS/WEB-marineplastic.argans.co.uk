THIS IS A DEMONSTRATOR FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY
--------------------------------------------------

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

MacOS 10.9 Big Sur Python 3.10
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Bionic Beaver Python 3.9
conda/venv/virtualenv (optional)

The code is compiled Cython distributed as dynamic
shared libraries, which may be incompatibile with
Linux distributions or MacOS versions that differ
from the build environment.

We recommend you create a python virtual environment
to install the dependencies. It is probably sufficient
to choose python=3 to install the most recent version
available for your OS environment.


INSTALATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Download the software

https://marineplastic.argans.co.uk/download

    username: mlopsi
    password: 0m3d*15P0-LM

The software is packaged as a Python wheel.

MacOS 10.9
opsi-1.0.0-cp310-cp310-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
opsi-1.0.0-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl


2. Create a new virtual environment and install dependencies

For conda the command:

    $ conda create -n <name> -c conda-forge python=3 PySimpleGUI matplotlib pandas py6s tqdm typing pyfiglet pyglet

Activate the envirnoment

    $ conda activate <name>


3. Create a folder and install the ML-OPSI package

    $ mkdir <folder> ; cd <folder>
    $ cp opsi-1.0.0-cp310-cp310-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl .
    $ pip install opsi-1.0.0-cp310-cp310-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl

All done!


OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

The software has a command line interface (CLI) and a
graphical user interface (GUI)

    $ opsi -h
    usage: opsi [-h] [-o OUTDIR] [-f CONFIG]

    Optical Performance SImulator

    options:
    -h, --help                  show this help message and exit
    -o OUTDIR, --outdir OUTDIR  path to output folder, [cwd]
    -f CONFIG, --config CONFIG  processor configuration JSON file

* Graphical User Interface

    $ opsi

Opens the GUI, which has a left panel to setup a simulation and
a right panel to plot results.

** Configuration

    SGM Scene Generation Module
    * select the types of litter from a multichoice menu
    * enter the desired fraction [0-1] separated by commas
    * select the water type from the dropdown menu

    AM Atmosphere Module
    * enable the module using the checkbox
    * enter input parameters
    * select aeosol type from dropdown menu

    IDM Instrument Detection Module
    * enable the module using the checkbox
    * select the sensor type from the dropdown menu

    The output folder can be selected using a filebrowser.
    Since output filenames are fixed it is recommended that a new
    folder is created for each run.

    A menu option, also accessible via a right click context menu,
    is to save the settings file as opsi.json, this is fixed and is
    saved to the working directory by default. The file is checked
    for correct format and values before saving. Errors are displayed
    on the logging console.

    A menu option, also accessible via a right click context emnu,
    is to load a settings file. A file browser window enables selection.
    The setting are checked on upload and errors notified on the
    logging console.

** Execution

    Run the simulation using the GREEN button.

    The configuration is checked for correctness before the program
    is exeuted and any errors are notifed on the logging console.

    Processing the full simulation on a 2.3GHz Quad-core i7 16GB RAM
    would take about a minute. YMMV

        WARNING the current version exhibits a bug when running
        the atmosphere module, 6SV. This routine is processor
        intensive and the Python Pool multiprocessing library is
        used to split the load over 8 processed. While processing
        the output to the logging console is locked and in this
        version neither is there a progress bar on the GUI.

    There IS a progress bar displayed on the terminal used to execute opsi.

** Outputs

    To plot a variable
    * select it from the plotting drop down menu
    * click PLOT
    * optionally save a PNG in the <output folder>

    To save outputs as CSV
    * select the outputs from the multiselection menu
    * click SAVE ALL

    The outputs will be saved in the <output folder> along with the
    opsi.json configuration file, and any saved plots.


* Command Line Interface

The command:

    $ opsi -f opsi.json -o <output folder>

with run a simulation, logging to stadout and to a file, opsi.log.



TROUBLESHOOTING

An issue has been observed with newly created virtual environments that
the Py6S package installtion did not install the 6SV RTM. Re-installing
fixed the issue.



SUPPORT

This is a demonstrator software and was never intended for distribution.
We are contractually obliged to provide this software but it is made
available 'as-is' and ARGANS have no obligation or current funding to
supporting this software. As a snapshot of work in progress, a prototype,
that has been useful to instruct and inform future work.



EVOLUTION

ML-OPSI as a configured instance of a generic, component-based, pluggable
framework for developing Earth Observation models, simulation, workflows
and data analytics will take years of development. The goal is a no-code
GUI-based virtual workshop enabling scientists and analysts access to a
toolbox of interchangeable building blocks and processing elements that
can be combined to satisfy non-programmers to build complex computational
systems. These systems could be end-to-end, multi-scale, simulations of a
sensor - a 'digital twin' updated in real-time with telemetry and data from
its operation, orbiting twim. It could be configured as a virtual lab to
create and run experiments and test hypotheses and algorithms. The potential
applications of an Earth Observation Modelling Environment (EOME) are many,
but the path to realisation will be lengthy.

This is why we made a start with ML-OPSI. A small step, and that is how
lean software development progresses. From a light-weight prototype that
questions our assumptions and refines our requirements.

Collaboration will be vital to move forward. This phase in the development
of an end-to-end marine litter detector has led us to consider a range of
technologies that could be applied with scales ranging from modelling
particle-photon interaction to mesoscale and gyral eddy-resolving ocean
circulation models, and all scales between. A multi-disciplinary approach
is advocated, integrating systems by interfacing rather than combination,
likely including federated services and distributed architecture,

ARGANS is seeking collaborators and funding opportunities to progress towards
these aims. To make first contact
